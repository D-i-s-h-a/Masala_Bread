To make this delicious Indian Masala Bread, we'll first start with our star ingredient - Yeast.
We will use yeast to bring the softness and sponginess in our bread.
Use the kind of flour that you prefer, I prefer keeping it healthy so I use Wheat flour.
Adding milk powder really brings in additional softness to the bread.
Try it.
Enjoy it.
Repeat.
